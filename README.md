## Project Overview
<b>UnityFund</b> allows users to set up, verify, and fund impactful projects. Our platform prioritizes security and authenticity, requiring both project creators and backers to authenticate before participating. Projects undergo a verification process involving an AI model (soon to be implemented) that assesses feasibility, with the potential for manual review to further ensure the project's integrity.

Once a project is approved, it‚Äôs displayed with comprehensive details and supporting documents for public viewing, making it easy for backers to make informed decisions. Multiple payment methods, including Google Pay, Stripe, and cryptocurrency, make it convenient to support projects from around the globe.


## User-Friendly Interface
The platform is designed with a clean, intuitive, and responsive UI using React and Material UI, providing users with an attractive and seamless experience. Our aim is to ensure that project creators and backers alike can navigate and use the platform with ease.
